# Choosing the Right Data Type in Java

Understanding which data type to use is crucial for efficient, readable, and correct code. Here's a guide to help you choose the right data type based on different scenarios.

## Scenario 1: Storing a List of Student Names

**Requirement**: Store a list of student names where the number of students is fixed or changes infrequently.

### Array

**Use**: If the number of students is known and doesn’t change frequently.

**Example**:
```java
// Array for storing student names
String[] studentNames = new String[5];
studentNames[0] = "Alice";
studentNames[1] = "Bob";
studentNames[2] = "Charlie";
studentNames[3] = "David";
studentNames[4] = "Eve";
```

**Why**: Arrays offer fast access to elements via indices and are efficient for a fixed number of elements.

## Scenario 2: Storing a List of Student Grades

**Requirement**: Store a list of student grades where students can be added or removed frequently.

### Linked List

**Use**: If you need to frequently add or remove students.

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.LinkedList;

LinkedList<Integer> studentGrades = new LinkedList<>();
studentGrades.add(85); // Grade for first student
studentGrades.add(90); // Grade for second student
// Add or remove grades as needed
```

**Why**: Linked lists allow efficient insertion and removal of elements without reallocating memory or shifting other elements.

## Scenario 3: Associating Student Names with Grades

**Requirement**: Associate each student's name with their grade and frequently access this data.

### HashMap

**Use**: When you need to store key-value pairs and need fast access based on keys.

**Example**:
```java
import java.util.HashMap;

HashMap<String, Integer> studentGradesMap = new HashMap<>();
studentGradesMap.put("Alice", 85);
studentGradesMap.put("Bob", 90);
// Access grade by name
int aliceGrade = studentGradesMap.get("Alice");
```

**Why**: `HashMap` allows for efficient key-based lookups and is useful for associating names with grades.
