Yes, you've got the right idea! Let me clarify and expand on both patterns a bit more to make sure it’s clear.

### Arrays

In an array, elements are stored in contiguous memory locations. This means that if you have an array of integers, and each integer takes up 4 bytes, the memory addresses for the elements are consecutive.

For example, if the base address of the array is `1000`, and the size of each integer is 4 bytes, then:

- `array[0]` (first element) will be at address `1000`
- `array[1]` (second element) will be at address `1004`
- `array[2]` (third element) will be at address `1008`
- `array[3]` (fourth element) will be at address `1012`

So the memory pattern for the array would be:
```
1000: a
1004: b
1008: c
1012: d
```

### Linked List

In a linked list, each element is a node that contains the data and a reference (or pointer) to the next node. These nodes can be scattered throughout memory. The references link the nodes together.

For example, let’s say you have a linked list with nodes containing integers, and the nodes are located at different memory addresses:

- Node 1 (containing value `a`) is at address `1000`
- Node 2 (containing value `b`) is at address `2000`
- Node 3 (containing value `c`) is at address `1500`
- Node 4 (containing value `d`) is at address `200` 

The linked list's structure would look like this:

- Node 1 at address `1000` points to Node 2 at address `2000`
- Node 2 at address `2000` points to Node 3 at address `1500`
- Node 3 at address `1500` points to Node 4 at address `200`
- Node 4 at address `200` may point to `null` if it's the end of the list

So the memory pattern for the linked list would be:
```
1000: a -> 2000
2000: b -> 1500
1500: c -> 200
200: d -> null
```

### Summary

- **Arrays**: All elements are in consecutive memory locations. Access is fast because the address of any element can be calculated directly.
- **Linked Lists**: Each node can be at any memory address. Accessing an element requires traversing from the start of the list, following the links.

This difference affects performance and memory usage depending on how you use these data structures.
