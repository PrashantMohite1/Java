# collection framework in java 

The Java collections framework is a set of classes and interfaces that implement commonly reusable collection data structures.

**Java Collection Interface** :- The Collection interface is the root interface of the collections framework hierarchy.Java does not provide direct implementations of the Collection interface but provides implementations of its subinterfaces like List, Set, and Queue.


## Collection Root Interface 

### List ( subinterface of Collection Interface ) :- 

Since List is an interface, we cannot create objects from it.

In order to use the functionalities of the List interface, we can use these classes:
  ArrayList
  LinkedList
  Vector
  Stack
