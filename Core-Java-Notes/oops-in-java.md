**Access Modifier**: Defines the access type of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application. 

In Java, there are 4 types of access specifiers: 

  -public: Accessible in all classes in your application.
  -protected: Accessible within the package in which it is defined and in its subclass(es) (including subclasses         declared outside the package).
  -private: Accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
  -default (declared/defined without using any modifier): Accessible within the same class and package within which     its class is defined.
