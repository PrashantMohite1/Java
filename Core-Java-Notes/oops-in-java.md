**Access Modifier**: Defines the access type of the method i.e. from where it can be accessed in your application. 

In Java, there are 4 types of access specifiers: 

1. public: Accessible in all classes in your application.
2. protected: Accessible within the package in which it is defined and in its subclass(es) (including subclasses         declared outside the package).
3. private: Accessible only within the class in which it is defined.
4. default (declared/defined without using any modifier): Accessible within the same class and package within which     its class is defined.
