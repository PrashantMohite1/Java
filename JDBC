5 steps in jdbc 

1. Load and Register the JDBC Driver:

      java
      Copy code
      Class.forName("com.mysql.cj.jdbc.Driver");
      This line loads the JDBC driver for your database. The driver is a software component that allows Java applications to interact with the database. Different databases require different drivers, and you need to load the appropriate driver for the database you're using.



2. Establish a Connection to the Database:


      String url = "jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/your_database";
      String username = "your_username";
      String password = "your_password";
      Connection connection = DriverManager.getConnection(url, username, password);
      
      
      **Purpose:**
      Establishing a connection to the database is the first and crucial step in interacting with any database. The connection object (`Connection`) represents a physical connection to the database server. It's required for creating statements and executing queries.
      
      - **Connection URL (`url`):** Specifies the location and properties of the database. In this example, it's a MySQL database running locally on the default port (3306). You need to adjust this URL based on your database type, location, and configuration.
      
      - **Username and Password:** Provide the credentials required to authenticate and connect to the database.

3. Create a Statement Object:

      ```java
      Statement statement = connection.createStatement();
      ```
      
      **Purpose:**
      Once you have a connection, you need a way to send SQL queries to the database. The `Statement` object is used for this purpose. It represents a simple SQL statement and allows you to execute queries, updates, and other SQL commands.
      
      - **Types of Statements:** There are different types of statements, such as `Statement`, `PreparedStatement`, and `CallableStatement`. In this example, a general `Statement` is used. However, for more complex scenarios and better performance, you might use `PreparedStatement` to execute parameterized queries.

4. Execute SQL Queries:
    
    ```java
    String query = "SELECT * FROM your_table";
    ResultSet resultSet = statement.executeQuery(query);
    ```
    
    **Purpose:**
    Executing SQL queries allows you to interact with the data stored in the database.
    
    - **SQL Query (`query`):** Represents the SQL command you want to execute. In this case, it's a simple SELECT statement to retrieve all rows from a table (`your_table`). You can modify the query to perform various operations like SELECT, INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE.
    
    - **ResultSet:** The result of a SELECT query is returned as a `ResultSet`. It represents a table of data resulting from a query. You can iterate over the `ResultSet` to retrieve and process the data.

5. close the opened connections 
      conn.close();
